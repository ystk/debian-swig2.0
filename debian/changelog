swig2.0 (2.0.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (closes: #584324).

      o Add ${misc:Depends} to all binary dependencies.

    years that "debian/rules clean" actually completes successfully.
  * debian/control: Bump Standards-Version to 3.9.1 (no changes).
  * debian/copyright: Update for upstream license change to GPLv3.

  * New upstream release.
  * debian/control: Remove ocaml from Build-Depends (not available in sid
    right now). Probably we can drop most of the build depends anyway, they
    do not affect the swig binary AFAIK. However, when running the test
    suite, we should better have them available...

  * debian/patches/keep_docs.diff: Change Doc/Manual/Makefile to keep 
    it from removing the documentation files on clean. They are included
    in the distribution and therefore should not get removed after the 
    build (closes: #441728).
    + debian/rules: Change clean target so that the patches are

    runtime support libraries).
  * debian/control: Bump standards-version to 3.6.1 (no changes).

    to swig1.3 instead of 1.3.21.
  * debian/rules: Make the name of the executable swig-1.3 instead of 
    swig-1.3.21.

swig1.3 (1.3.21-4.1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * NMU.
  * Add php4-cgi to build dependencies (closes: #246452).

 -- Matthias Klose <doko@debian.org>  Sat,  8 May 2004 08:31:57 +0200

swig1.3 (1.3.21-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control: Remove Conflicts-Depends-cycle between swig and 
    swig1.3 as proposed by Jeroen van Wolffelaar (closes: #231854).
    And of course those cycles for the -doc and -examples packages as
    well.
  * debian/control: Make swig1.3 depend on at least version 1.3.0 of swig.

 -- Torsten Landschoff <torsten@debian.org>  Mon, 19 Apr 2004 10:56:16 +0200

swig1.3 (1.3.21-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Split off chicken and guile runtime support into different packages
    to reduce dependency load... (closes: #231701).

swig1.3 (1.3.21-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Applied patch courtesy of David Kimdon:
  + Include full version number in soname (closes: #234028). 
    - debian/control : Rename libswig1.3 package to libswig1.3.21.
    - debian/libswig1.3.files debian/libswig1.3.postinst : Rename these
      files to use the full 1.3.21 version.
    - debian/links : Symlinks need to use full 1.3.21 version.
    - debian/rules : Pass 1.3.21 release suffix to configure.
      Fix definition of SWIG in example Makefiles.  That doesn't need 
      to include the version number since we have the 
      swig -> swig-1.3.21 link.

swig1.3 (1.3.21-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (closes: #225036).
  * debian/rules: Updated clean target to only remove stuff that's
    actually there.
  * debian/swig-examples.examples: Adapt to removal of Examples/perl
    and addition of Examples/contract.
  * Makefile.in (install-m4): Obey $(DESTDIR) setting.
  * Fixed pike support:
    - debian/control: Add build dependency pike7.4-dev.
    - debian/rules: Pass pike include path to configure.
  * configure.in: Fix checking for php4 includes (uses php4-config
    which is not there on Debian and overwrite the manually passed
    include path using the output of that non-existing program).
  * debian/rules: Call runtime and install-runtime targets as well
    to actually build the runtime libraries (which were built by
    default before).

swig1.3 (1.3.19-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Acknowledge NMU (closes: #202036, #199738). Thanks, Matthias!
  * debian/control: Rename swig1.3 -> swig in binary packages.
    This way we replace all binary packages of the former swig 
    source package...
    + It does not need to build anymore (closes: #160316).
    + The error in the old description will die with it (closes: #209726).
    + Our examples deal with current perl already (closes: #107979).
    + We have no dangling manpage link (closes: #185271). In fact I 
      think the bug never applied to swig.
    + New swig already has Java support enabled (closes: #178237).
    + And Perl 5.8 is already supported (closes: #155004).
  * debian/rules: Merge the commands for swig-doc and swig-examples into
    a single binary-indep target.

  * Swig1.3 now follows policy version 3.5.9.
  * Added the previously nonexistant package swig1.3-doc. (Closes: #169422)
  * Added the correct supported languages to description. (Closes: #156376)
  * Fixed description synopses.
  * Added chicken-dev, gcj-3.2, and gij-3.2 to the build-depends.
  * We now build with Java support as well, thanks to gcj. Hurray for gcj!
  * Bumped tcl/tk 8.3-dev to tcl/tk 8.4-dev in the build-depends
  * Updated Ye Olde README.Debian.
  * Runtime/Makefile.in: Pass $(PERL5_CCFLAGS) when building the perl
    parts.

swig1.3 (1.3.17-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Runtime/Makefile.in: Remove the perl hack.
  * debian/rules: Pass the CFLAGS used to build perl to the configure script.
    This should hopefully enable building of the perl module again.
  * configure.in: Apply David's TCL patch and rerun autoconf.
  * debian/rules: Clean up symlinks created by the build.

swig1.3 (1.3.14-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (closes: #157108).
    + The missing ")" at Lib/perl5/std_string.i:48 was added upstream 
      (closes: #158420).
  * Lib/guile/typemaps.i: Fix passing of structures by value (closes: #156902).
  * debian/control: Add build dependency on ocaml, pike7.2 and update python 
    version to 2.2. 
  * debian/control: Pass /usr/bin/python2.2 as python path.
  * Tools/check-include-path.pike: Just return "/usr/include/pike7.2". 
    Ugly hack, but I want it to work now. A proper patch will follow.
  * Runtime/Makefile.in: Another ugly hack. When generating libperl.c, 
    drop the first #include <string.h>, as it breaks the perl headers 
    for some obfuscated reason.

swig1.3 (1.3.11-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (closes: #138979).

    of that package (closes: #140287).

 -- Torsten Landschoff <torsten@debian.org>  Fri, 29 Mar 2002 01:56:07 +0100

swig1.3 (1.3.10-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * debian/rules (clean): Remove .../config.log and generated files.
  * debian/rules (build): 
    + Use python2.1 instead of 1.5.
    + Seperately building the "runtime" target not longer needed.
    + Pass skip-java to the make invocations (I have java on my system
      for my computer science studies, but I don't want to move swig to 
      contrib)
    + Enable building of php4 and Mzscheme support.
  * debian/control (Build-Depends): 
    + Force python-dev to be 2.1*
    + Add libguile-dev, mzscheme-dev, php4-dev
  * debian/dirs: Better add /usr/lib if we want it to build...
  * Split off the libswig1.3 package containing just the runtime 
    libraries which are now really build. swig1.3 now depends on 
    that package, therefore the installation is now complete
    (closes: #123434).
  * debian/rules (binary): Run dh_makeshlibs to build the shlibs files 
    for the runtime in libswig1.3 (closes: #108040).
  * debian/rules (swig1.3-doc-pdf): Remove target as the package did never
    exist...
  * debian/control: Make swig1.3 conflict with and replace swig and
    remove "[alpha]" from the Description.
  * debian/libswig1.3.postinst: Call ldconfig (lintian).
  * debian/rules (build): Set PHP4INC before running configure to 
    get around the configure.in incapability.
  * debian/rules: Remove the old filter on the Makefiles of the examples 
    and run a new one to set the path to swig correctly
    (hopefully fixes #107929).

 -- Torsten Landschoff <torsten@debian.org>  Sun, 13 Jan 2002 16:35:56 +0100

swig1.3 (1.3.9-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (closes: #107846).
  * Get the ruby support built in (closes: #105320):
    + debian/control: Depend on ruby along with ruby-dev.
    + debian/rules: Pass "--with-ruby=/usr/bin/ruby" to ./configure.
  * debian/rules: Did not find tcl anymore - added path to tclConfig.sh 
    to the ./configure invocation.
  * debian/rules (install-stamp): The old way of overriding the
    installation root for the install target does not work anymore, but
    DESTDIR is supported now so use that for installation.
  * debian/rules (clean): Remove all config.status files (collect them
    using find, I am lazy this time). Found by lintian.
  * debian/rules: Remove invocation of dh_suidregister (build message).

    of swig (closes: #108435).

swig (1.1.p5-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Used guile-config to get linking options in examples/Makefile 
    (closes: #34038).
  * Applied patch from Drake Diedrich to support Polymorphic return types.
    The development release already has this patch but it might take a
    while to get ready for prime time. As the patch seems not to break
    anything I included it for Debian (closes: #39927, #39946).
